# Crime-Data-Analysis
In this project, I worked with a real-world crime dataset spanning from 2020 to 2023, focusing on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and predictive modeling. I began by acquiring and inspecting the dataset, followed by extensive data cleaning tasks, including handling missing data, removing duplicates, converting data types, standardizing numerical values, and encoding categorical data. Through exploratory data analysis, I visualized crime trends, analyzed seasonal patterns, identified the most common crime types, and examined regional differences using tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Additionally, I investigated correlations between economic factors and crime rates, analyzed crime frequency by day of the week, and studied the impact of major events on crime rates. To forecast future crime trends, I employed predictive modeling techniques using ARIMA and Prophet. Finally, I prepared a comprehensive report summarizing the data cleaning process, analysis, visualizations, and key findings, demonstrating my ability to handle complex datasets, perform detailed data analysis, and utilize predictive modeling techniques to generate actionable insights.
